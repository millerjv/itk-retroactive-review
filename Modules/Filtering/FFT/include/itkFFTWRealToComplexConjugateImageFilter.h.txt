This filter is poorly named because this actually does a forward FFT transform not just conversion from real to complex.  The "Conjugate" in the name is also misleading.  A better name would be itkFFTWForwardFFTImageFilter.  

Many of the functions have acronymns in the name, making it difficult to figure out what they do.  Examples are: Plan_dft_r2c.  As ITK methods, they should be more descriptive even though the FFTW methods that they call have similar names
