This filter is poorly named because this actually does an inverse FFT transform not just conversion from complex to real.  The "Conjugate" in the name is also misleading.  A better name would be itkVNLInverseFFTImageFilter. 

In case 3, the order of arguments may be incorrect: should it be (outputSize[1], outputSize[0], outputSize[2]) which is (rows,columns,depth)?

ConstantPadImageFilter is listed in the documentation but not used. 

The filter checks whether the image size is a legal dimension, which is good.
