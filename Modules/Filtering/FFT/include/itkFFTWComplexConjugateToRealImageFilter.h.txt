This filter is poorly named because this actually does an inverse FFT transform not just conversion from complex to real.  The "Conjugate" in the name is also misleading.  A better name would be itkFFTWInverseFFTImageFilter.  

Many of the functions have acronymns in the name, making it difficult to figure out what they do.  Examples are: Plan_dft_c2r.  As ITK methods, they should be more descriptive even though the FFTW methods that they call have similar names
