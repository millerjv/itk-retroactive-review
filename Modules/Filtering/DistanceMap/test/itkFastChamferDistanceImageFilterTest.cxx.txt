Coverage
--------

Improved coverage by testing in dimension 1, 2, 3 and 4.

To this end, one templated test has been created (template over the image
dimension).

Arguments of the templated function are respectively:
* the number of inner positive elements
* the number of inner negative elements
* the rest

The test is valid if the number of expected elements (see above) matches
the number of elements while running the test in dimension 1, 2, 3 and 4.
