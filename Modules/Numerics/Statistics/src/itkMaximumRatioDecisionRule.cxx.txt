This class has been replaced by
itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule2. itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule2 has been renamed to
itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule with the following changes.

Format of method declarations did not match style. Fixed.

Class missing PrintSelf() method. Fixed.

Changed implementation so if no priors are set, then assume a uniform prior.

Changed implementation to avoid nearly dividing by zero.  Method is now calculated as p( x | i ) p(i) ? p( x | j ) p(  j ).

Ideally, there would be a scale factor applied to the ratio of priors
so you could manage/balance the risk (balance Type I and Type II
errors). But this is hard to do for anything other than a two class
problem. (This is the only thing that keeps it from being marked "Done".)
