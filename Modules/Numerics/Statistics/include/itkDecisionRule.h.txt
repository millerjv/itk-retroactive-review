This class is part of the refactoring of statistics framework. It
serves the purpose of the original itkDecisionRuleBase.h.  This is a
near duplicate of DecisionRuleBase. It is not a subclass of
DecisionRuleBase and it does not support the full API of
DecisionRuleBase. This appears to be by design.

Class and methods are not sufficiently documented. Fixed.

PrintSelf() method only called superclass method. Removed.

Class labels are restricted to be unsigned int. Changed to be a typedef to a std::vector::size_type

Discriminant values are restricted to be double. Added a typedef for the value type.
