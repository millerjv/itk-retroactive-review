Class documentation is not adequate. Fixed.

CentroidType defined from DistanceFunction and is not defined as the TVector type of the class. This could make is a bit more challenging to swap between various membership functions. Hopefully the DistanceMetrics get templated over the same vector type as the membership function.

The API to various MembershipFunctions is inconsistent. Some use SetMean/SetCovariance while this one uses SetCentroid.

Clone method declaration needs to match superclass. Fixed.
