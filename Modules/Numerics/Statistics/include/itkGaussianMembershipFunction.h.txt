Class documentation incomplete. Fixed.

Documentation on MeanType is inadequate. By itself, it looks like the mean is defined as a scalar type. Fixed.

Method documentation incomplete. Fixed.

Clone() method defined here but not in superclass. Redefine method to return a smartpointer to MembershipFunctionBase. Make the method const. Fixed.

Copy constructor and operator= declarations missing. Fixed.

GetMean(), GetCoveriance() should return references. Fixed.
