Class documentation incomplete. Fixed.

MeasurementVectorSizeType is unsigned int. Should this be a size_t?

Method documentation incomplete. Fixed.

Missing copy constructor and operator= declarations (without implementations). Fixed.

m_MeasurementVectorSize should be protected. Fixed.

Clone() not defined but defined in subclasses. Fixed.

Do we need the word "Base" in the classname?
