This class has been replaced by
itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule2. itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule2 has been renamed to
itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule with the following changes.

It is hard to recognize that this decision rule is Bayes rule (or Hypothesis testing). Perhaps the motivation for not calling this a BayesDecisionRule is that neither the discriminant scores nor the a priori values are necessarily probabilities.

Class and method documentation insufficient. Fixed.

Class missing PrintSelf() method. Fixed.

Class should be renamed itkMaximumRatioDecisionRule. Fixed.

Discriminant values are doubles. Prior probabilities are float. Changed priors to match membership value types.

SetAPriori() method should take a const reference. Method should be called SetPriorProbabilities(). Fixed.

Changed implementation so if no priors are set, then assume a uniform prior.

Doxygen does not generate for this class. Check if new class documentation works. Inline formula spanned two comment lines which I think Doxygen does not like.

Changed implementation to avoid nearly dividing by zero. Method is now calculated as p( x | i ) p(i) ? p( x | j ) p(  j ).

Ideally, there would be a scale factor applied to the ratio of priors so you could manage/balance the risk (balance Type I and Type II errors). But this is hard to do for anything other than a two class problem. (This is the only thing that keeps it from being marked "Done".)
