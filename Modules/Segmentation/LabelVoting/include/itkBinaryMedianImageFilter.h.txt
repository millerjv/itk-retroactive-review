Fixed minor typo/grammar errors.

This filter is a similar implementation of the MedianImageFilter, but for
binary images (MedianImageFilter performs unnecessary operations when the input
image is binary).  Perhaps this implementation could be merged with the
MedianImageFilter implementation as an extra input flag when the input is binary.
