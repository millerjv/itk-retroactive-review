Fixed minor typos & grammatical errors, but the following issues still exist:

1) This file uses the "bio" namespace, so the filename is not technically the same as class name, and
there have been discussions about limiting extra namespaces.

2) Method documentation should be in the .h file, not the .txx file.

3) Class layout should be
	a) Public methods come first.
	b) Protected methods follow.
	c) Private members come last.

This class has:
	a) Public 
	b) Protected 
	c) Public
	d) Protected
