Fixed minor errors (typos, grammar), but the following issues still exist:

1) This file uses the "bio" namespace, so the filename is not technically the same as class name, and
there have been discussions about limiting extra namespaces.

2) Method documentation for copy method should be in the .h file, not the .cxx file.

3) Class layout contains two public sections, which could be consolidated into one public section
