Fixed minor errors, but the following issues remain:

1) Filter should report ProgressEvents or IterationEvents

2) The file contains the following comment:
"//TODO: Choose more reasonable defaults for specifying the initial means
//to the KMeans filter. We could also add this as an option of the filter."

Should follow up with the author to see if this to-do can be implemented.
